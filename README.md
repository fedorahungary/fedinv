FedInv
======

FedInv is the Federated Inventory Manager. It functions as a distributed inventory manager, meaning that there is no central warehouse, where all the items are stored, but instead everyone acts as a warehouse, from where people can order and request items. Albeit, if you want to use it as a centralized inventory manager, you can setup the users as such and use it that way.
